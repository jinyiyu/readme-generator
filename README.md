## About this Project

This project is a README generator using Node.js and the inquirer package. The user will be asking series of prompt questions in the terminal about the information of their project.

After the user's submited responses, a fine markdown file will be generated, the layout will be a Title(with a license badge if you choose one), a table of content, and a listing of all your main sections that would cover the answers you submitted before.
